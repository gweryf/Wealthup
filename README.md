Below the design I have created a simple to-do list  with the following features:
- Input field. After entering text and hitting enter, it creates a new task and shows it in the list below.
- Search input next to the input field. When typing something in it, the list only shows the tasks that match the search string.
- All the tasks have two buttons - complete and delete. Completed tasks are greyed, and deleted todo are removed from the list.
